# Technical Authoring Standards

Follow these strict technical requirements when expanding the suite:

### 1. Locator Stability
- One element, one locator. Do not provide multiple locator options (backup selectors) for a single element. 
- If a locator changes in the UI, the test should fail so we can identify the change. 
- Prefer ID, or unique CSS selectors over brittle XPaths.

### 2. Setup and Teardown
- Always implement proper setup and teardown logic using PyTest fixtures.
- Ensure the application state is cleaned up after each test execution to maintain test isolation.

### 3. Autonomous Page Object Updates
- When creating a new test, if an interaction is missing from `src/pages/`, you must automatically create the necessary method.
- You must use the `SeleniumExtended` base class wrappers (e.g., `wait_and_click`) for all new interactions.
- Never use raw driver commands or `time.sleep()`. Unless you have to and there is no better way.

### 4. Descriptive Assertions
- All assertions must include a failure message explaining what was expected vs what was found.
