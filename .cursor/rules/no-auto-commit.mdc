# Git Commit Policy

## Critical Rule: No Automatic Commits

**NEVER commit code unless the user explicitly asks you to commit.**

### What This Means

- ❌ **DO NOT** commit after making changes
- ❌ **DO NOT** commit when you think changes are "complete"
- ❌ **DO NOT** commit as part of a workflow unless explicitly asked
- ❌ **DO NOT** assume "commit and push" is implied

### When You CAN Commit

✅ Only commit when the user explicitly says:
- "commit the changes"
- "commit and push"
- "go ahead and commit"
- "commit this"
- Any other explicit instruction to commit

### What To Do Instead

When you make changes:
1. Make the code changes
2. Inform the user what was changed
3. Wait for explicit instruction to commit
4. If you think a commit might be needed, ask: "Would you like me to commit these changes?"

### Examples

**❌ WRONG:**
```
User: "Fix the bug in config_helpers.py"
AI: [makes changes] [commits automatically] "Fixed and committed!"
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
User: "Fix the bug in config_helpers.py"
AI: [makes changes] "Fixed the bug. The changes are ready. Would you like me to commit them?"
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
User: "Fix the bug and commit it"
AI: [makes changes] [commits] "Fixed and committed!"
```
